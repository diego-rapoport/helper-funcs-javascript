# What is this about?
This is just a repository where I'll fill some helper functions that I use at work or if I did inside a project. It's not primarily intended to be done in the most performant way, but I do accept insights and PRs to improve them.

# What I won't necessarily do?
I'm not intended to turn this into a library nor willingly solve any specific cases. Feel free to fork, modify and use it on your own risk and responsability.

_Yes I've done that by myself, but of course there'll be reference to the work of others. Therefore I will not demand the need of aknowledgment of those functions._
